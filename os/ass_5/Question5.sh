#  Rajeshâ€™s basic salary (BASIC) is input through the keyboard. His dearness 
# allowance  (DA)  is  52%  of  BASIC.  House  rent  allowance  (HRA)  is  15%  of 
# BASIC.  Contributory  provident  fund  is  12%  of  (BASIC  +  DA).  Write  a  shell 
# script to calculate his gross salary and take home salary using the following 
# formula:   Gross salary = BASIC + DA + HRA  
# Take home salary = Gross salary - (BASIC + DA) * 0.12
